# Docticon
Web App used for converting files, initially just to PDF. 

So, the idea with this here project is to tackle an actual problem I'd like to tackle and also to use it as an opportunity to run into obstacles which should help me grow and revise web dev concepts which I embarrassingly have not worked on in a while. Anyway...

##Core Features
-Simple GUI
-File Upload
-Select PDF as output format
-Button for conversion
-Conversion animation
-Feedback (Success/Failure to convert message)
-Download link

##Tech Stack (If I can even really call it that)
-Ideally just the core web languages HTML, 
-CSS
-and JavaScript initially
-JavaScript for conversion in the browser as well
